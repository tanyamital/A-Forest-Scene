# A-Forest-Scene

Forests are present in most places of the Earth. They are the ecosystems that provide us with a lot of basic necessities like wood, food, air and other products that we use in our 
daily lives. This project showcases a scene from one such forest and outlines the various components of a forest. This application can be used to bring awareness of the beauty of forests amongst people and could also be used as a teaching tool for young children to learn about the rich biodiversity that mother nature provides. This application is interactive in the form that on mouse clicks certain components of the forest appear to move. The application integrates the concepts of computer graphics, Open GL API and 
C/C++ Programming.
